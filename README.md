# Next.js useRouter Hook Unexpected Navigation

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the `useRouter` hook in Next.js, where incorrect usage can lead to unexpected navigation behavior.

## Bug Description
The `useRouter` hook is used to access and manipulate the router object, allowing for navigation between pages. However, if not used correctly, it can result in unexpected redirects or navigation problems.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Notice that clicking the "Go back to Home" button may not always navigate back to the home page as expected.

## Solution
The issue stems from how the `router.push()` method interacts with the component's rendering lifecycle.  Ensuring proper usage of `router.push` within an event handler usually resolves the problem.  See `bugSolution.js` for the fix.
